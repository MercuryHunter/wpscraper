# wpscraper
A Writing Prompt Scraper for Reddit

There will be two versions of this scraper, with slightly different output.

The first is already made: the no_api scraper, which as the name says, doesn't use the Reddit API, but instead just trawls the pages, and uses regexes to parse the HTML (Ugh!)

The next will be an api scraper, which will make use of the Reddit API to retrieve pages, comments etc.

Use with python from the command line, set up options for subreddits according to the style at the top.
